Developed a responsive Grocery Shopping Application using React, HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS for the front end, ensuring an intuitive user interface. The backend is powered by Spring Boot REST API, integrating Spring Data JPA and Spring Security for efficient data management and secure authentication. Utilizing tools like IntelliJ, VSCode, Git, and GitHub for collaborative development with version control, the system supports separate logins for customers and sellers. Sellers can add items, and customers can seamlessly search, select, add to cart, and purchase items.
